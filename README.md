# SHRAVAN
The SHRAVAN( Smart Hearing and Ranging for Assistive Voice-based Adaptive Navigation)
project aims to help visually impaired people navigate their surroundings beyond the white cane
and live more independent and confident lives. This is a headwear device that is equipped with a
camera and a tof(time of flight sensor) to receive input from the surroundings using a yolov7
image recognition algorithm with our machine learning data set inside a Raspberry Pi 4 model B
we will provide the necessary information regarding the surroundings to our user. The TOF
sensor also detects the distance of the objects using haptic feedback and is connected to vibration
motors around the forehead that vibrate in emergencies when an object is too near.

> This project was completed as part of the course requirements for CS1841: Engineering Explorations.
